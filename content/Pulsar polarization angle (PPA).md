Two alternate ways of arriving at the pulsar polarization angle:
1. [[PPA (spherical trig)|Spherical trigonometry]]
2. [[PPA (vector algebra)|Vector algebra]]

Below is the triangle with all the relevant angles and sides shown.

![[PPA triangle]]

There are three triangles to consider:
1. The larger triangle $\hat{k}\hat{M}\hat{\Omega}$. **The most important one!**
2. The smaller right triangle with sides $\varphi$ and $\beta$.
3. The enveloping (isosceles) triangle, in which $\xi = \alpha + \beta$ and $\chi + \chi' = \pi/2$.
